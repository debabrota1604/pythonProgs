Some question-answer sets for a Python Django interview, tailored for a Senior Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience. These questions cover a range of topics, from fundamental Django concepts to more advanced architectural and performance considerations.

Set 1: Core Django & ORM

Q: Explain the Django MVT (Model-View-Template) architectural pattern. How does it differ from MVC (Model-View-Controller)?

A: Django uses MVT:
    Model: Represents the data structure and interacts with the database.
    View: Contains the business logic and prepares data to be displayed. It's a Python function or class-based view. Crucially, it receives the HTTP request and returns the HTTP response.
    Template: A presentation layer (HTML, XML, etc.) that displays the data received from the view.
    Difference from MVC: In MVC, the controller handles user input and updates the model. In Django, the framework itself acts as the controller, handling the request and routing it to the appropriate view. The view is more responsible for the application's logic than a traditional MVC controller. The URL dispatcher acts as the front controller.

Q: Describe the Django ORM. What are its advantages and disadvantages? Give examples of how you've used it to optimize database queries.

A: The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) allows you to interact with databases using Python code instead of writing raw SQL.
Advantages:
    Abstraction: Abstracts away database-specific details, making the application more portable.
    Security: Helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    Productivity: Provides a high-level API for common database operations.
Disadvantages:
    Performance: Can be less efficient than hand-optimized SQL for complex queries.
    Complexity: The ORM can sometimes hide the underlying database operations, making it difficult to understand performance bottlenecks.
Optimization Examples:
    select_related(): For one-to-one and foreign key relationships, pre-fetches related objects in a single query, avoiding N+1 query problems.
    prefetch_related(): For many-to-many and reverse foreign key relationships, pre-fetches related objects using a separate query for each relationship, but still more efficient than N+1.
    values() and values_list(): Retrieve only the necessary fields, reducing the amount of data transferred from the database.
    annotate(): Add calculated fields to querysets using database functions.
    raw(): Execute raw SQL queries when the ORM is insufficient. (Use with caution to avoid SQL injection).
    Using indexes properly.
    QuerySet caching.

Q: How do you handle database migrations in Django? What are some best practices for managing migrations in a team environment?

A: Django's migration system allows you to evolve your database schema over time.
    python manage.py makemigrations: Creates new migration files based on changes to your models.
    python manage.py migrate: Applies pending migrations to the database.
    python manage.py showmigrations: Shows the status of migrations.
Best Practices:
    Commit migrations to version control: Treat migration files as part of your application's code.
    Run migrations in a consistent order: Ensure that all developers and deployment environments apply migrations in the same order.
    Use atomic migrations: Wrap migrations in a transaction to ensure that they either succeed completely or are rolled back in case of failure. (Django's default behavior is atomic).
    Test migrations: Write tests to verify that migrations correctly update the database schema and data.
    Squash migrations: Periodically squash older migrations into a single migration to simplify the migration history (using python manage.py squashmigrations). This should be done carefully, usually in a development environment first.
    Be careful when altering existing columns, especially those with large amounts of data. Consider adding new columns and migrating data in batches.

Set 2: Views, Templates, and Forms

Q: Explain the difference between function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs) in Django. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? When would you choose one over the other?

A:
FBVs: Simple Python functions that take a request object as input and return a response.
    Advantages: Simpler for basic views, easier to understand for beginners.
    Disadvantages: Can become repetitive for complex views, less reusable.
CBVs: Python classes that inherit from Django's View class or its subclasses (e.g., TemplateView, ListView, DetailView).
    Advantages: More reusable, better for complex views with multiple actions (e.g., handling different HTTP methods), easier to organize code using inheritance and mixins.
    Disadvantages: Can be more complex to understand initially, steeper learning curve.
When to Choose:
    Use FBVs for simple views that perform a single action.
    Use CBVs for more complex views that require multiple actions, reusable logic, or inheritance. CBVs are generally preferred for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Q: How do you use Django's template engine? What are some common template tags and filters? How can you create custom template tags and filters?

A: Django's template engine renders dynamic content into HTML or other text-based formats.
Template Tags: Provide logic and control flow within templates (e.g., {% if %}, {% for %}, {% extends %}, {% include %}).
Template Filters: Modify the output of variables (e.g., {{ value|date:"Y-m-d" }}, {{ value|lower }}, {{ value|truncatewords:30 }}).
Custom Template Tags and Filters:
Create a templatetags directory inside your app.
Create a Python file (e.g., my_tags.py) inside the templatetags directory.
Register the tags and filters using the template.Library class.
Load the tags in your template using {% load my_tags %}.
Example:
Q: Explain Django's form handling process. What are the benefits of using Django's forms? How do you handle form validation and security?

A: Django's form handling simplifies the process of creating, validating, and processing HTML forms.
Benefits:
HTML Generation: Automatically generates HTML form fields.
Validation: Provides built-in validation for common data types.
Security: Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Data Cleaning: Cleans and converts data to the correct types.
Form Handling Process:
Define a form class that inherits from django.forms.Form or django.forms.ModelForm.
In the view, create an instance of the form.
If the request method is POST, populate the form with the request data.
Call form.is_valid() to validate the data.
If the form is valid, access the cleaned data using form.cleaned_data.
Save the data to the database (if using a ModelForm).
Render the form in the template.
Validation:
Use built-in validators (e.g., required=True, max_length, email).
Add custom validation logic to the form's clean() method or to individual field's clean_<field_name>() methods.
Security:
Use Django's built-in CSRF protection (Cross-Site Request Forgery). Include {% csrf_token %} in your form.
Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks. Django's template engine automatically escapes HTML by default.
Set 3: Advanced Django & Architecture

Q: How do you handle authentication and authorization in Django? Explain the different authentication backends and permission systems.

A:
Authentication: Django provides a built-in authentication system for managing users, passwords, and sessions.
django.contrib.auth: Provides models (User, Group), views (login, logout), and forms for authentication.
Authentication Backends: Determine how users are authenticated. The default backend uses the User model. You can create custom backends to authenticate against external systems (e.g., LDAP, OAuth).
Authorization: Controls what users are allowed to do.
Permissions: Django's permission system allows you to grant specific permissions to users and groups. Permissions are defined on models.
@permission_required decorator: Restricts access to views based on permissions.
has_perm() template tag: Checks if a user has a specific permission in a template.
Custom Permission Logic: You can implement custom permission logic in your views or models.
Groups: Organize users into groups and assign permissions to groups.
Example:
Q: Describe different caching strategies in Django. How do you choose the appropriate caching strategy for a particular application?

A: Caching can significantly improve the performance of Django applications by reducing the number of database queries.
Types of Caching:
Per-site cache: Caches the entire website. (Middleware-based).
Per-view cache: Caches the output of individual views (using the cache_page decorator).
Template fragment caching: Caches specific parts of templates (using the {% cache %} template tag).
Database caching: Caches the results of database queries.
Object caching: Caches individual objects.
Caching Backends:
Memory-based: LocMemCache (for single-process development), RedisCache, MemcachedCache.
File-based: FileBasedCache (for development or small deployments).
Database-based: DatabaseCache (not recommended for high-performance applications).
Choosing a Caching Strategy:
Identify performance bottlenecks: Use profiling tools to identify the slowest parts of your application.
Consider the cache invalidation strategy: How often does the data change? Choose a caching strategy that is appropriate for the data's volatility.
Balance performance and complexity: More aggressive caching can improve performance but also increase complexity.
Start with per-view caching: A good starting point for many applications.
Use template fragment caching for expensive template rendering: Cache the output of complex template fragments that don't change frequently.
Use database caching for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often: Use with caution, as it can be difficult to invalidate the cache correctly.
Use a distributed cache (Redis, Memcached) for multi-server deployments: Ensures that all servers have access to the same cache data.
Q: How do you handle asynchronous tasks in Django? What are the benefits of using asynchronous tasks? Describe different task queues and their trade-offs.

A: Asynchronous tasks allow you to offload long-running or blocking operations from the main request-response cycle, improving the responsiveness of your application.
Benefits:
Improved performance: Reduces the response time for web requests.
Scalability: Allows you to handle more concurrent requests.
Reliability: Tasks can be retried if they fail.
Task Queues:
Celery: A popular distributed task queue.
Pros: Mature, feature-rich, supports a wide range of brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis).
Cons: Can be more complex to set up and configure.
Redis Queue (RQ): A lightweight task queue that uses Redis as a broker.
Pros: Simple to set up, good performance.
Cons: Fewer features than Celery.
Alternatives: Dramatiq, Huey.
Trade-offs:
Complexity: Distributed task queues like Celery can add complexity to your application.
Overhead: Task queues introduce some overhead, so they are not suitable for very short-running tasks.
Broker Choice: The choice of broker (RabbitMQ, Redis) depends on your application's requirements. RabbitMQ is more robust but can be more complex to manage. Redis is simpler but may be less reliable.
Example (Celery):
Set 4: API Design & Security

Q: How do you design RESTful APIs in Django? What are some best practices for API versioning, authentication, and rate limiting?

A:
RESTful Principles:
Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Use nouns (resources) in URLs (e.g., /articles, users).
Use HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure.
Use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) to provide links to related resources.
Django REST Framework (DRF): A powerful toolkit for building RESTful APIs in Django.
Serializers: Convert data between Python objects and JSON.
ViewSets: Provide a set of actions for a resource (e.g., list, create, retrieve, update, destroy).
Authentication: Supports various authentication schemes (e.g., Basic Authentication, Token Authentication, OAuth).
Permissions: Controls access to API endpoints.
API Versioning:
URI Versioning: Include the version number in the URL (e.g., /v1/articles, /v2/articles).
Header Versioning: Use a custom header to specify the version (e.g., Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json).
Authentication:
Token Authentication: Generate unique tokens for users.
OAuth 2.0: Delegate authentication to a third-party provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object.
Rate Limiting:
Limit the number of requests that a user can make within a given time period.
Use DRF's built-in rate limiting or implement custom rate limiting logic.
Consider using a distributed rate limiter (e.g., Redis-based) for multi-server deployments.
Q: What are some common security vulnerabilities in Django applications? How can you prevent them?

A:
SQL Injection: Prevent by using the Django ORM and avoiding raw SQL queries (or sanitizing input if raw SQL is necessary).
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Prevent by using Django's template engine, which automatically escapes HTML. Sanitize user input if you need to allow HTML.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Prevent by using Django's CSRF protection. Include {% csrf_token %} in your forms.
Authentication and Authorization Issues: Use Django's built-in authentication and permission systems correctly. Implement strong password policies.
Session Hijacking: Use HTTPS to encrypt session cookies. Set the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
Clickjacking: Prevent by setting the X-Frame-Options header.
File Upload Vulnerabilities: Validate file uploads to prevent malicious files from being uploaded.
Denial of Service (DoS): Implement rate limiting and other measures to prevent attackers from overwhelming your server.
Information Disclosure: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or logs.
Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Use tools like bandit to scan your code for common security issues.
Q: How do you test Django applications? What are the different types of tests you should write?

A: Testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Django applications.
Types of Tests:
Unit Tests: Test individual components (models, views, forms) in isolation.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different components.
Functional Tests: Test the application from the user's perspective (e.g., using Selenium).
Acceptance Tests: Verify that the application meets the requirements of the stakeholders.
Testing Tools:
Django's built-in testing framework (unittest).
pytest: A popular third-party testing framework.
coverage.py: Measures code coverage.
Selenium: For functional testing.
Best Practices:
Write tests early and often (test-driven development).
Aim for high code coverage.
Use a continuous integration (CI) system to run tests automatically.
Write clear and concise tests.
Use fixtures to set up test data.
Mock external dependencies to isolate your tests.

Q: How do you profile and optimize the performance of a Django application? What tools and techniques do you use?

A:
Profiling Tools:
Django Debug Toolbar: Provides insights into database queries, template rendering, and other performance metrics.
cProfile: A Python profiler that measures the execution time of each function.
memory_profiler: Measures the memory usage of your code.
New Relic, Datadog: Commercial APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools.

Keep-Alive Connections:
Enable keep-alive connections to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.
Q: How do you scale a Django application to handle a large number of users and requests? What are the different scaling strategies you can use?

A:
Vertical Scaling:
Increase the resources (CPU, memory, storage) of a single server.
Limited by the maximum capacity of a single server.
Horizontal Scaling:
Add more servers to the application.
Requires load balancing to distribute traffic across the servers.
Requires a shared database and a shared cache.
Database Scaling:
Read Replicas: Use read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database.
Database Sharding: Partition the database across multiple servers.
Caching:
Use a distributed cache (Redis, Memcached) to cache frequently accessed data.
